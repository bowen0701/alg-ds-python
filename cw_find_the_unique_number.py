"""Codewars: Find the unique number
6 kyu

URL: https://www.codewars.com/kata/find-the-unique-number-1/

There is an array with some numbers. All numbers are equal except for one.
Try to find it!

find_uniq([ 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1 ]) == 2
find_uniq([ 0, 0, 0.55, 0, 0 ]) == 0.55

Itâ€™s guaranteed that array contains more than 3 numbers.

The tests contain some very huge arrays, so think about performance.

This is the first kata in series:
- Find the unique number (this kata)
- Find the unique string
- Find The Unique
"""

def find_uniq(arr):
    # your code here
    return n   # n: unique integer in the array


def main():
    pass


if __name__ == '__main__':
