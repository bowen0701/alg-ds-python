"""Leetcode 293. Flip Game (Premium)
Easy

URL: https://leetcode.com/problems/flip-game

You are playing the following Flip Game with your friend: Given a string that
contains only these two characters: + and -, you and your friend take turns to
flip two consecutive "++" into "--". The game ends when a person can no longer
make a move and therefore the other person will be the winner.

Write a function to compute all possible states of the string after one valid
move.

Example:
Input: s = "++++"
Output: 
[
  "--++",
  "+--+",
  "++--"
]
Note: If there is no valid move, return an empty list [].
