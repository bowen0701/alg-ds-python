"""Leetcode 225. Implement Stack using Queues
Easy

URL: https://leetcode.com/problems/implement-stack-using-queues/

Implement the following operations of a stack using queues.
- push(x) -- Push element x onto stack.
- pop() -- Removes the element on top of the stack.
- top() -- Get the top element.
- empty() -- Return whether the stack is empty.

Example:
MyStack stack = new MyStack();
stack.push(1);
stack.push(2);  
stack.top();   // returns 2
stack.pop();   // returns 2
stack.empty(); // returns false

Notes:
- You must use only standard operations of a queue -- which means only 
  push to back, peek/pop from front, size, and is empty operations are valid.
- Depending on your language, queue may not be supported natively. You may simulate
  a queue by using a list or deque (double-ended queue), as long as you use only
  standard operations of a queue.
- You may assume that all operations are valid (for example, no pop or top
  operations will be called on an empty stack).
