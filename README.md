# Algorithms & Data Structures

This repo is to collect my practices for **algorithms and data structures**. The following are the main references I use and highly recommend:

- Cormen, Leisenson, Rivest & Stein (2009). Introduction to Algoruthms, 3ed.
- Millar & Ranum (2011). [Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures Using Python, 2ed](http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/pythonds/index.html).
- Hetland (2010). Python Algorithms.

Cormen et al. (2009) is of course classic and comprehensive, containing modern algorithms's concepts, theoretical foundations and pseudo codes. Millar & Ranum (2011) explains clearly algorithms's concepts and provides implementations in Python, from which I learned a lot. Hetland (2000) goes quickly through algorithms's concepts and implementations in Python as well.

Finally, why algorithms and data structures? Because I think both are important for us who would like to implement fast data ETL and machine learning algorithms.
