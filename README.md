# Python Algorithms & Data Structures

This repo is to collect my practices for **algorithms and data structures with Python**, mainly based on Brad Millar and David Ranum's great book: [Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures Using Python, 2ed](http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/pythonds/index.html). Of course, some scripts are practices for other resources, for example, [MIT 6.00 Introduction to Computer Science and Programming.](http://ocw.mit.edu/6-00F08) 

Why algorithms and data structures? Because I think both are important for us who would like to implement fast data ETL and machine learning algorithms.
