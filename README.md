# Algorithms & Data Structures

Algorithms and data structures implementations in Python. 

The following are the main references I use and highly recommend:

- Cormen, Leisenson, Rivest & Stein (2009). Introduction to Algorithms, 3ed.
- Jordan (2005). Efficient Algorithms and Intractable Problems, a.k.a. Introduction to CS Theory (Lecture Notes). 
- Millar & Ranum (2011). [Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures Using Python, 2ed](http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/pythonds/index.html).

I actually started from Millar & Ranum (2011) since it clearly explains algorithms and data structures concepts and provides implementations in Python, from which I learned a lot. Further, to deeply study these topics, I dived into Cormen et al. (2009) and Jordan (2005)'s lecture notes, where the former is classic and comprehensive, containing modern algorithms and data structures concepts, theoretical foundations, and pseudocodes, while the latter is a wonderful summary for the former and is lectured by a master of machine learning. Both references are highly recommended. :-)

Algorithms and data structures matter because they are important for us who would like to implement fast data ETL and machine learning algorithms.
