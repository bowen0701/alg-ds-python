# Algorithms & Data Structures

Algorithms and data structures implementations in Python. 

The following are the main references I use and highly recommend:

- Cormen, Leisenson, Rivest & Stein (2009). Introduction to Algorithms, 3ed.
- Jordan (2005). Efficient Algorithms and Intractable Problems, a.k.a. Introduction to CS Theory (Lecture Notes). 
- Millar & Ranum (2011). [Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures Using Python, 2ed](http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/pythonds/index.html).

I actually started from Millar & Ranum (2011), it explains clearly algorithms and data structures concepts and provides implementations in Python, from which I learned a lot. Further, to deeply study these topics, I dived into Cormen et al. (2009) and Jordan (2005)'s lecture notes; the former is of course classic and comprehensive, containing modern algorithms and data structures concepts, theoretical foundations and pseudocodes, and the latter is a wonderful summary for the former and is lectured by a master of machine learning. Both references are highly recommended. :-)

Why algorithms and data structures? Because I think both are important for us who would like to implement fast data ETL and machine learning algorithms.
