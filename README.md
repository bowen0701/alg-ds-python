# Python Algorithms & Data Structures

This folder is to collect my summary and practices for **algorithms and data structures with Python**, mainly based on Brad Millar and David Ranum's great book: [Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures Using Python, 2ed](http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/pythonds/index.html). 

Why algorithms and data structures? Because I think both are important for us who would like to implement fast data ETL and machine learning algorithms.
