# Algorithms & Data Structures

This repo is to collect my practices for **algorithms and data structures**, including **notes and implementations using Python**. Now I mainly focus on 

- Brad Millar and David Ranum's great book: [Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures Using Python, 2ed](http://interactivepython.org/runestone/static/pythonds/index.html).

Why algorithms and data structures? Because I think both are important for us who would like to implement fast data ETL and machine learning algorithms.
