Hard

URL: https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-with-at-most-k-distinct-characters/

Given a string, find the length of the longest substring T that contains at most k
distinct characters.

Example 1:
Input: s = "eceba", k = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: T is "ece" which its length is 3.

Example 2:
Input: s = "aa", k = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: T is "aa" which its length is 2.
