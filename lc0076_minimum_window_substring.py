"""Leetcode 76. Minimum Window Substring
Hard

URL: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-substring/

Given a string S and a string T, find the minimum window in S which will contain
all the characters in T in complexity O(n).

Example:
Input: S = "ADOBECODEBANC", T = "ABC"
Output: "BANC"

Note:
- If there is no such window in S that covers all characters in T, return the
  empty string "".
- If there is such window, you are guaranteed that there will always be only one
  unique minimum window in S.
